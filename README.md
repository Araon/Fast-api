# Fast-Api
To be a good backend dev you need to know how to make api(s), so this is my attempt to make on using Fast api, i thought of making one using flask but 
i've read some places that fast api is actually good and is "FAST" for an api(which tbh did't even matter to me xD). So now along with bandwagon of a trend How does this actully work?, Not like indepth analysis but as a dev or student who wants to lean how to make an api, for that is this really easy!.

## How to run
``` pipenv install ```

``` uvicorn main:app --reload ```
